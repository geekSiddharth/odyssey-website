No Forms List:
    "a-cappella": {},
    "battle-troupe": {},
    "blind-date": {},
    "can-you-duet": {},
    "pwned": {}, (removed)
    "sumo-wrestling": {},

Some problems with data (won't affect deployment of non-problem events though):
 1. a-cappella, battle-troupe, blind-date, can-you-duet, pwned, sumo-wrestling don't have a google form in their website folders so I am just generating form for member data for them (no additional fields)
 2. art-attack, design-360, pwned, and gupchup doesn't have team size in the doc, so form can't be generated for them
 3. design-360 and pwned details are missing from the doc
